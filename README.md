# Time-Series-Clustering-Global-Terrorism-Database
Exploratory Analysis on the Global Terrorism Database using time-series clustering. 
First I conduct EDA and convert the dataset into a multivariate time-series format by country. 
Then, I explore a number of techniques for finding the centroid of a cluster of time-series., all involving Dynamic Time Warping as the distance measure.
